# Chatting
### Python-based package that answers simplistic questions and can be taught by Human input & AI input.

# FAQ
Currently still in development.

# Examples
### Ask Question
```py
from chattin import client

cli = client(debug=False) # debug=True
def ask(q: str):
  return cli.ask(q) # cli.ask(q, ai=True), instead of using my terrible data, it will use an AI to respond to your desired question. 
  
print(ask("hi!")) 
```

### Train
```py
from chatting import client

cli = client(debug=False)
def train(q: str, a: str):
  return cli.train(q, a) # cli.train(q, ai=True), this will train data using AI, b/c human input could be sometimes confusing :).
print(train("training test", True))
```

During this time i was more productive than i have ever been, the sheer amount of sugar cane i harvested would have been enough to give at least 2 americans diabedies. During this time I met like minded indiviuals i would form a bond with in brazil. I became a second father to them, i cared for them when they were sick, assisted them in their work. This is why they call me sugar daddy"
